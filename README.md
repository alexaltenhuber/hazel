![Hazel](http://c7.github.com/hazel/images/hazel_small.png)

A simple Sinatra app generator, heavily based on [snfn](https://github.com/zachpendleton/snfn).

![Using Hazel](http://c7.github.com/hazel/images/using_hazel.gif)

## Installation

    gem install hazel

## Configuration

* `--capistrano` Include Capistrano
* `-d` Database. Options are "postgres," "mysql," "sqlite", and "mongo."
   Default is ""
* `--redis` Include Redis configuration options.
* `--rvm` Create .ruby-version (ruby-2.1.0) and .ruby-gemset
* `--bundle` Run bundle after generating the app
* `--git` Initialize a Git repository

## Example

Standard app, using sqlite.

    hazel my_app

App using MySQL and Redis.

    hazel my_app -d mysql --redis

App using MongoDB and Redis, then run bundle install.

    hazel my_app -d mongo --redis --bundle

App using Redis, RVM, and Git repo

    hazel my_app --redis --rvm --git-repo

## Architecture

The template autoloads files in config/initializers and
/lib. Database configuration options are stored in `config/db.yml`
and are loaded via `config/initializers/database.rb`.

## DB Setup

[Sequel](http://sequel.rubyforge.org) is used as an ORM for
relational databases, and migrations are stored in db/migrate.
Migrations can be run using the rake command `rake db:migrate`.

[mongodb_model](https://github.com/alexeypetrushin/mongodb_model)
is used for Mongo apps, with the config options
stored in the same files as relational databases (`config/db.yml`
and `config/initializers/database.rb`).
